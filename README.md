# EESNN-epileptic-seizure-detection
This is the code link of our paper "Efficient and generalizable cross-patient epileptic seizure detection through a spiking neural network". In addition, it also includes the code of the methods of the paper "Cross-patient automatic epileptic seizure detection using patient-adversarial neural networks with spatio-temporal EEG augmentation".
